# [start:end:step] start through not past end, by step

# Avoid using start, end, and stride together in a single slice.
# If you need all three parameters, consider doing two assignments
# (one to slice, another to stride)
# Slicing and then striding will create an extra shallow copy of the data.
# The first operation should try to reduce the size of the resulting slice
# as much as possible.
# If your program canâ€™t afford the time or memory required for two steps,
# consider using islice from the itertools.
letters[:]  # Copy of the elements
letters[:5]  # [0, 5)
letters[:-1]  # [0, last)
letters[4:]  # [4, )
letters[-3:]  # [-3,)
