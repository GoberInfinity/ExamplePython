# A mix-in is a small class that only defines a
# set of additional methods that a class should provide. Mix-in classes donâ€™t define their
# own instance attributes nor require their __init__ constructor to be called.
# Avoid using multiple inheritance if mix-in classes can achieve the same outcome
# Compose mixins to create complex functionality from simple behaviors
