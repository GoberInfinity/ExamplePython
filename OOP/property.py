# Define new class interfaces using simple public attributes, and avoid set and get methods.
# if you decide you need special behavior when an attribute is set, you can migrate to
# the @property decorator and its corresponding setter attribute.
# In order to work properly the name of both the setter and getter
# methods must match the intended property name.
# Ensure that @property methods are fast; do slow or complex work using normal methods.
# The big problem with the @property attributes of the same class.
# They also canâ€™t be reused by unrelated classes, use Descriptors for reusable @property methods
