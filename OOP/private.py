# The only time to seriously consider using private attributes is when youâ€™re worried
# about naming conflicts with subclasses.
# This problem occurs when a child class unwittingly
# defines an attribute that was already defined by its parent class.
# This is primarily a concern with classes that are part of a public API
# the subclasses are out of your control
