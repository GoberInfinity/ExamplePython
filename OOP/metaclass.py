# Metaclass is a class whose instances are classes
# (Classes are instances of metaclasses)
# You can gain leverage by modify the way that classes are produced by performing
# extra actions or injecting code.
# When this is the case, you can use metaclass programming to modify the way that some
# of your class objects are created.
# In the vast majority of cases, you donâ€™t need metaclasses
