# Segment Tree

## Notes

Segment Tree is used in cases where there are multiple range queries on array, the idea is basically a binary tree used for storing the intervals or segments. Each node in the Segment Tree represents an interval.

There are things that a segment tree can do but a [Binary Indexed](../BinaryIndexedTree/Info.md) Tree cannot.
